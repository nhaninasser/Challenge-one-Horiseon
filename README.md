The challenge was to refactor a webpage to make it accesible and to improve search engine optimization.
It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 
To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge, you should go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

I was able to find the semantic elements and adjust them to better the layout of the HTML.
I changed the semantic HTML elements in order to better organize the html file.
I made changes to the structure of the HTML for better styling and postiioning.
I added alt attributes to the images.
I also combined selectors in the css to organize and group together similar parameters.

## Acceptance Criteria


* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a professional README describing the project.
